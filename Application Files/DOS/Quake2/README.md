Welcome to the home of the worlds first FULL VERSION of Quake II running on the web! This, unlike every other port, runs the PC files, and isn't an emulation of Quake II for the N64. 

This project was first started by Stefan Haustein and worked for a little while until at some point in time it broke. Later Magnus fixed it, and since that moment, Magnus wasn't able to figure out how to make a full port.

One morning, on 12/21/2022 @ 12pm Magnus had an itch.He dug deeper and deeper into this seemingly endless rabbit hole. Most of his work had nothing to do with code, it was simply getting the files in order. Thus the birth of the PlayN-Quake-II-Magnus-Port.

**MAGNUS HAS LEGALLY BOUGHT QUAKE 2, THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!**

For the more avid readers, here is a more indepth look at the additions Magnus made:

> The original source code was added to the project.

> Magnus created download.js.

> Magnus created PlayNQuake folder adding the following:
- E635C924D74AFB6527B814C542FC5B1C.cache.html (correcting audio issues, setting initial spawn map, enabling save and load states).
- PlayNQuake.nocache.js.

> Magnus edited original HTML file.

> Magnus has done the following with the Quake2.EXE file:
- Deleted all unnecessary files.
- Added Quake 2 game assets.
- Edited config file to better suit usage hosted on a website.
- Deleted .pak1 and .pak2 files.
  - Ngl the most difficult part of this was getting the .EXE small enough to fit on my website.

*Here are some other things Magnus would like to add to this project:*

- [ ] Add multiplayer support.
- [ ] Add back .pak1 and .pak2 files.
- [ ] Fix lighting.
